predict_this("Don't care what anyone says, 6 hours in on Xbox One S (yes, the ol stormtrooper from 2016) #Cyberpunk2077 is freaking amazing!!! üòç The pacing, the immersion... twists and turns. I don't think I've ever been taken to another world in any game quite like this. Bravo @CDPROJEKTRED")
predict_this("I accepted the fact that it won't run as beautifully as it should in my old rig so I made my peace with that and moved on. I am now focused on the gigs and quest and I must say just like the rest of my RPGs this one got me hooked as well. Maybe a little more fixes and it's nova.")
predict_this("Seriously the prettiest game I've ever played! #Shutterpunk2077 #Cyberpunk2077")
predict_this("Alright, I think those CYBERPUNK 2077 Hotfix patches are working, cause the game's a lot smoother now. Still has the environment rendering issues like crazy, but it's definitely better than release day. Think I might just be able to do a review on it very soon! ")
predict_this("I‚Äôve played 15 hours of #Cyberpunk2077 on #XboxSeriesX and it‚Äôs been an absolute thrill ride.  I honestly still have a lot to learn in game and I feel like I‚Äôve just scratched the surface. Feels slightly daunting, but addictive. Story  and graphics are really great.")
predict_this("The gigs and side missions are all top notch aswell, and even the random encounters are filled with bunch of cool / sad lore that you can read and discover so I've had a lot of fun exploring and doing as much as I can within #Cyberpunk2077 for my first run! :3")
predict_this("Had a lovely stream, #Cyberpunk2077 FINALLY got past the beginning section cause I‚Äôm crazy busy and don‚Äôt put enough time towards the game. Thank you all for watching with me. Had a chance to raid @HearneMariah shoot her a follow on twitch, she is awesome!")

predict_this("Couldn‚Äôt say better myself! The game is definitely worth it. I‚Äôve only played a few hours in, cause I‚Äôm more in a mood for Skyrim this time of the year, but from what I saw, the only bags I had were funny ones I only laughed at. Played on #SeriesX.")
predict_this("I've gotta say that despite its obvious problems, #Cyberpunk2077 has done a really good job with its side characters, most of them have good and intriguing quests. I hope we get to see even more of #JudyAlvarez in maybe a future DLC? ;) @CDPROJEKTRED #PS4share #videogames")
