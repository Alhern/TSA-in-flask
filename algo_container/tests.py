predict_this("Cyberpunk 2077 is honestly the best game I've played in my life, all the b*tchn and moaning about glitches is the biggest joke I've heard, almost 40 hours in and I've only experienced like 7 minor background glitches, that's less than most games but we don't talk about that, huh?")
predict_this("Don't care what anyone says, 6 hours in on Xbox One S (yes, the ol stormtrooper from 2016) #Cyberpunk2077 is freaking amazing!!! 😍 The pacing, the immersion... twists and turns. I don't think I've ever been taken to another world in any game quite like this. Bravo @CDPROJEKTRED")
predict_this("I accepted the fact that it won't run as beautifully as it should in my old rig so I made my peace with that and moved on. I am now focused on the gigs and quest and I must say just like the rest of my RPGs this one got me hooked as well. Maybe a little more fixes and it's nova.")
predict_this("Seriously the prettiest game I've ever played! #Shutterpunk2077 #Cyberpunk2077")
predict_this("Alright, I think those CYBERPUNK 2077 Hotfix patches are working, cause the game's a lot smoother now. Still has the environment rendering issues like crazy, but it's definitely better than release day. Think I might just be able to do a review on it very soon! ")
predict_this("I’ve played 15 hours of #Cyberpunk2077 on #XboxSeriesX and it’s been an absolute thrill ride.  I honestly still have a lot to learn in game and I feel like I’ve just scratched the surface. Feels slightly daunting, but addictive. Story  and graphics are really great.")
predict_this("The gigs and side missions are all top notch aswell, and even the random encounters are filled with bunch of cool / sad lore that you can read and discover so I've had a lot of fun exploring and doing as much as I can within #Cyberpunk2077 for my first run! :3")
predict_this("Had a lovely stream, #Cyberpunk2077 FINALLY got past the beginning section cause I’m crazy busy and don’t put enough time towards the game. Thank you all for watching with me. Had a chance to raid @HearneMariah shoot her a follow on twitch, she is awesome!")
predict_this("Finally finished #Cyberpunk2077! Loved everything about the story and gave me the same feeling I had with Fallout: New Vegas. Now I’m just going to wait for all the patches, so I can play it again and have a better experience.")

predict_this("I am having a lot of fun with driving in cockpit/first-person mode with both cars &amp; bikes. The detailing is nice &amp; the vehicle designs r amazing. #Cyberpunk2077")
predict_this("Couldn’t say better myself! The game is definitely worth it. I’ve only played a few hours in, cause I’m more in a mood for Skyrim this time of the year, but from what I saw, the only bags I had were funny ones I only laughed at. Played on #SeriesX.")
predict_this("I've gotta say that despite its obvious problems, #Cyberpunk2077 has done a really good job with its side characters, most of them have good and intriguing quests. I hope we get to see even more of #JudyAlvarez in maybe a future DLC? ;) @CDPROJEKTRED #PS4share #videogames")
